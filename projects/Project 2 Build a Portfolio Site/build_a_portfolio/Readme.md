# Build A Portfolio Website
### Summary:
This webpage was created specifically for Udacity's Front End Developer Developer Nanodegree.

For this project, you'll be building a portfolio website. You will be provided a design mockup as a PDF-file, and you must replicate that design in HTML and CSS. You will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects you will complete through the course of your Nanodegree program. Please note that while you should aim to recreate the mockup, you may also use your own custom images to personalize this project.

### Instructions:

1) Download the design mockup file from the Downloadables section (in the lower right hand corner of your screen, just below this text) and review it.
2) Identify the various boxes you will need to build in order to recreate this design.
3) Write your HTML and CSS files, continue to iterate until your work is representative of the design mockup.
4) Take the time to personalize your portfolio with custom colors, additional content and your own images.
5) Validate your HTML and CSS against the W3C's Validators.
